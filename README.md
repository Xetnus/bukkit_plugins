# bukkit_plugins
Bukkit plugins I developed while I was in high school.

Most of these Bukkit plugins were developed for clients (i.e. Minecraft server
owners) during my free time in high school. However, some of the plugins were
developed just as a proof of concept or to test my programming abilities. Due
to this, some of the plugins in this repository may not be completed and some
of the code may not be in working order.

It's important to note that since I've developed these plugins, my coding style
has gone through significant changes and improvements.

NOTE: Necessary files for running the plugins you see in this repository have
been omitted. You won't be able to run these plugins on any server by simply
copying the code. If you're interested in using any of these plugins,
contact me and I can supply the missing files.
